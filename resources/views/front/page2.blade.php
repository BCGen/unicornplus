                    <p class="text-justify">Welcome to Unicorn Kids Bilingual School. I would like to use this
                        opportunity to
                        introduce the background of our school via this website. <br> <br> Unicorn Kids Bilingual
                        School was
                        established in 2018 to nurture the kids by widening their horizon by enhancing their language
                        abilities,
                        through a series of hands-on activities and experiences. Due to the worldwide phenomenon of
                        globalization,
                        there is and will be potential demand of acquiring an additional set of language skills. <br>
                        <br> In the
                        increasingly globalized world we live in, more than half of the population is bilingual or
                        multilingual.
                        In
                        order to thrive in a diverse society, an additional language not only puts your child ahead of
                        others in
                        terms of job opportunities, but also is an asset which helps develop essential cognitive
                        skills, such as
                        creativity, critical thinking, problem solving, and logic.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Established in 2018 in Tokyo as a school teaching an international curriculum in English and
                        Mandarin.
                        Our school’s mission is to nurture today’s children through extending their horizon by
                        designing an
                        educational environment which is both fun and effective for children’s learning. We believe
                        providing
                        children with hands on experience can be more rewarding than conventional studies.
                    </p>
                    <div class="tittle2">Our Vision</div>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        In the process of learning to converse in English, the school will provide opportunities for
                        children to
                        apply what they have learned in a practical manner. For example, when children come across a
                        new
                        vocabulary, the teacher will make sure the student fully comprehends the word through creating
                        sentences
                        and reusing it in different contexts.
                        In addition, we stress on the importance of children’s moral education. We believe establishing
                        a
                        foundation for ethics and fundamental etiquette for communication is essential in the world of
                        rapid
                        globalization such as understanding the significance of gratitude and becoming future
                        contributors to
                        society.
                        We also help children discover their identity, such as managing their emotions, building
                        self-confidence,
                        learning to respect and share with others, and teamwork building capabilities.
                        Extra-curricular activities are provided and included in the daily schedule, including: music,
                        calligraphy, gymnastics, art and dance. We help children realize their potential and what they
                        are
                        skillful at to further develop their talents. We are strong advocates for learning happily and
                        developing
                        their interests in the process.
                        Classics of different languages are played throughout the day to stimulate the children’s brain
                        development and learn to be able to adjust. Other opportunities will be provided to help
                        children train
                        and develop the abilities to deal with various tasks and appropriately handle different matters
                        to help
                        them grow stronger and be better prepared.</p>
